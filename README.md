# UFEDKMLstacker
UFEDKMLstacker is a Python script designed to merge and visualize KML files exported from Cellebrite UFED [^1] using Plotly [^2]. This tool allows the stacking of multiple KML files to demonstrate overlapping locations of different data sources, each represented by a distinct color. By integrating this functionality, UFEDKMLstacker aids in forensic analysis and visualization, offering valuable insights into spatial relationships between different entities. Inspired by [UFEDMapper](https://github.com/ot2i7ba/UFEDMapper) and [UFEDKMLmerge](https://github.com/ot2i7ba/UFEDKMLmerge), this script has been customized to meet specific forensic needs, enabling professionals to streamline their workflow. Sharing this tool aims to benefit others in the forensic community.

> [!NOTE]
> This script is specifically tailored for KML files exported from Cellebrite UFED. Its compatibility or performance with KML files from other sources has not been tested.

> [!WARNING]
Please note that this script is currently under development, and I cannot provide a 100% guarantee that it operates in a forensically sound manner. It is tailored to meet specific needs at this stage. Use it with caution, especially in environments where forensic integrity is critical.

   ```

## Follow the Prompts
- **KML File Selection**<br>The script will search the directory for KML files and present a numbered list for selection.
- **Remark for Each File**<br>Enter a remark for each selected file to identify it in the visualization.
- **Color Assignment**<br>Colors are automatically assigned to each file for differentiation in the visualization.

## Interactive Map
The resulting map visualizes the data points from each KML file in distinct colors. The user can interact with the map, hover over points to see details, and filter based on the provided remarks.

## PyInstaller
To compile the UFEDKMLmerge script into a standalone executable, you can use PyInstaller. Follow the steps below:

1. Install PyInstaller (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Compile the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --name UFEDKMLstacker --icon=ufedkmlstacker.ico UFEDKMLstacker.py
   ```

- `--onefile`: Create a single executable file.
- `--name UFEDKMLmerge`: Name the executable UFEDMapper.
- `--icon=ufedkmlstacker.ico`: Use ufedkmlmerge.ico as the icon for the executable.

**Running the executable**: After compilation, you can run the executable found in the dist directory.

## Releases
A compiled and 7zip-packed version of UFEDKMLstacker for Windows is available as a release. You can download it from the **[Releases](https://github.com/ot2i7ba/UFEDKMLstacker/releases)** section on GitHub. This version includes all necessary dependencies and can be run without requiring Python to be installed on your system.

Please note that console logging (log_to_console=False) is set to False in compiled version. This means that log outputs will be written to a file rather than displayed in the console.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An internet connection is required to display the maps in the generated HTML files. This is because the maps are rendered using Plotly, which relies on online resources to load the map tiles and other visualization components. Rest assured, no information from your local system is sent to Plotly during this process. The map data is sourced from OpenStreetMap [^3], ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations.

# Example

## The script lists available KML files and prompts for selection**
   ```sh
   Available KML files:
   1. Example1.kml
   2. Example2.kml
   3. Example3.kml
   e. Exit
   
   Enter file numbers to merge (e.g., 1, 2, 5) or 'e' to exit:
   ```

## After selecting files, the script prompts for remarks
   ```sh
   Enter a remark for the file Example1.kml: Alpha
   Enter a remark for the file Example2.kml: Bravo
   Enter a remark for the file Example3.kml: Charlie

   Processing Example1.kml ... done!
   Processing Example2.kml ... done!
   Processing Example3.kml ... done!
   ```

## The interactive map is then generated and saved
   ```sh
   Statistics saved in C:\YOUR\PATH\TO\UFEDKMLstacker\KML_Statistics.xlsx.
   Statistics saved in C:\YOUR\PATH\TO\UFEDKMLstacker\KML_Statistics.csv.

   Process completed successfully. Details are available in the log, Excel file, and CSV file.
   ```

# Changes

## Changes in 0.0.3

- **Global Color Mapping Definition**<br>The color mapping (color_name_map) has been moved to a global scope, making it accessible throughout the script without needing to redefine it locally within functions.
- **Enhanced Logging Configuration**<br>The configure_logging() function now includes an optional log_to_console parameter, allowing users to control whether log messages are shown in the console. By default, this parameter is set to True, showing only ERROR level messages in the console while logging all levels to the log file.
- **Extended Timestamp Parsing**<br>Additional regular expression patterns have been added to the parse_timestamp() function to handle a wider range of timestamp formats, improving the robustness and versatility of timestamp parsing.
- **Corrected Statistics Calculation**<br>The calculation of statistics has been corrected to ensure all values are counted accurately. This includes proper counting of total points, points with timestamps, and points without timestamps, enhancing the reliability of the reported data.
- **New Statistic Metric**<br>A new metric, points_without_timestamps, has been added to the statistics. This metric tracks the number of geopoints that do not have associated timestamps, providing more detailed insights into the data.
- **Spinner Animation During Processing**<br>A spinner animation has been introduced to provide visual feedback during the processing of KML files. The spinner shows the current file being processed and stops once processing is complete, improving user experience by indicating ongoing activity.

## Changes in 0.0.2

- **Synchronous Processing**<br>The script has been updated from asynchronous to synchronous processing to enhance compatibility and reliability. The use of asyncio and aiofiles has been removed.
- **File Selection Limitation**<br>A new feature limits the selection to a maximum of 10 KML files at a time. This constraint ensures that the script processes only a manageable number of files simultaneously.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**<br>Improved error handling mechanisms have been introduced to catch and log specific exceptions such as FileNotFoundError, ValueError, and XMLSyntaxError more effectively.
- **Input Validation**<br>Additional validation steps have been implemented to ensure that user inputs are correct, avoiding invalid characters or excessively long entries.
- **Extended Timestamp Processing**<br>The timestamp parsing has been extended to support more formats, ensuring that various timestamp formats can be recognized and parsed correctly.
- **Saving Statistics**<br>Separate Excel and CSV files (KML_Statistic.xlsx and KML_Statistic.csv) have been introduced to store detailed statistics about the processed KML files. This adds an extra layer of control and documentation, complementing the existing Merged_Colored files.
- **Logging Configuration**<br>Logging settings have been optimized to provide a logical separation between console and file logging. Console logging now only displays messages at the WARNING level and above, while detailed debug information is still recorded in the log file.

## Changes in 0.0.1
- Initial release.
